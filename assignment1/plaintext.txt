Why did Caesar love his cipher so much?
Because it made him feel like a real shift leader.
Fun Fact: Caesar’s cipher shifted each letter by 3. Simple, but it kept casual snoops away from his military
orders.
Why did the Spartan message look like nonsense?
Because it was taken out of context (literally off the stick).
Fun Fact: A strip of parchment wrapped around a rod revealed the text. Without the right rod, the letters were
scrambled.
Why did the Atbash cipher fail its test?
Because it always gave the opposite answer.
Fun Fact: Atbash, from ancient Hebrew, simply flips the alphabet (A->Z, B->Y, etc.). It’s one of the oldest known
substitution ciphers.
Why don’t Vigenere users ever lose arguments?
Because they always have the last key.
Fun Fact: Using a repeating keyword, Vigenere disguised letter frequencies, baffling cryptanalysts for centuries.
Why was the Playfair cipher bad at sports?
Because it couldn’t handle singles.
Fun Fact: Playfair (1854) encrypts pairs of letters instead of singles. It was used in WWI and WWII for field
communications.
Why is ROT13 like a boomerang?
Because what you send out always comes back the same.
Fun Fact: ROT13 shifts letters by 13. Encrypting twice returns the original text--so decryption is the same as
encryption.
Why was the one-time pad always invited to parties?
Because it was perfectly secure.
Fun Fact: If truly random and never reused, the one-time pad is unbreakable. The problem: sharing and keeping the
pads secret.
Why did the Enigma machine hate small talk?
Because everything it said came out complicated.
Fun Fact: With billions of possible settings, Enigma seemed unbeatable. Allied cryptanalysis cracked it, shaping
the outcome of WWII.
Why did the Lorenz cipher break up with Enigma?
Because it wanted a bigger wheel of fortune.
Fun Fact: Lorenz SZ machines, used by Nazi high command, were even more complex than Enigma. British
cryptanalysts built Colossus to crack them.
Why do cryptographers always carry snacks?
Because they believe in secure chips.
Fun Fact: Today’s ciphers rely on hard math problems (like factoring big numbers or modular arithmetic) instead
of simple letter tricks.
